abstract = {Can mobile phone data improve program targeting? By combining rich survey data from a “big push” anti-poverty program in Afghanistan with detailed mobile phone logs from program beneficiaries, we study the extent to which machine learning methods can accurately differentiate ultra-poor households eligible for program benefits from ineligible households. We show that machine learning methods leveraging mobile phone data can identify ultra-poor households nearly as accurately as survey-based measures of consumption and wealth; and that combining survey-based measures with mobile phone data produces classifications more accurate than those based on a single data source.}

abstract = {In the past few years consumers have enjoyed consuming video content on a growing number of devices including the traditional television, personal computers, mobile phone and tablets. Each device has its own technical attributes and associated consumption characteristics. This research examines the differential effects of user experience on engagement during video consumption in the mobile and desktop environments. We have experimented with different situations related to the genre, the sequence of playing, the extent of interruption, the timing of the interruption, and length of the video clips. Our model was quantitatively tested, with 270 users taking part in a between subject experiment. In the mobile environment, our results provide evidence that sensory experience is a significant factor for enjoyment and engagement with the video, while emotional response is not. The reverse is true for the desktop environment. Learning curve factors work differently in the two environments. User enjoyment and engagement are significantly moderated by learning curve factors in the mobile environment only. The result is robust as it is true for both previous learning (usage experience with the device), and on-the-go experience (sequencing of video clips). Attention span only affects engagement and enjoyment in the desktop environment. Outside interruption only affects engagement and enjoyment in the mobile environment. Our findings can inform commercial practices on the video design and user interface, and also enhance our understanding of the contextual dependency of the theoretical concept of engagement in mobile entertainment.}

abstract = {To date, prior studies have placed considerably less emphasis on the determinants of learners' acceptance of mobile learning (m-learning). Hence, this study's purpose was to combine the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) to examine whether technological characteristics (including navigation and convenience) and compatibility as the antecedents to learners' beliefs affected their intention to use m-learning. Sample data for this study were collected from Taiwanese mobile phone users; a total of 750 questionnaires were distributed, and 486 usable questionnaires were analyzed in this study, with a usable response rate of 64.80%. Collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. This study showed that technological characteristics (including navigation and convenience) and compatibility had significant effects on perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived enjoyment (PE) of m-learning; besides, PU, PEOU, PE, and compatibility, respectively, exhibited significantly strong impacts on intention to use m-learning, and PEOU indirectly affected intention to use m-learning via PU and PE. The results of this study show that learners can judge m-learning by how well it meets their perceived compatibility of m-learning, and they will regard m-learning as a useful, easy to use, and enjoyable tool if they can explore it themselves through the content and interface screens over the mobile-based learning environments at any time in any location, and these situations will further facilitate their intention to use m-learning. In conclusion, the views of the extended TAM with the IDT provide clear expositions of learners' beliefs, which affect their intention to use m-learning.}
