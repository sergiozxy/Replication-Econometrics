This repository replicates the paper entitled "ABC, 123: Can Mobile Phones Improve Learning? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Niger"

I replicated the main result of DID and DDD part and conducted prerequisite verfication of contagious test.

The codes contains the stata code to conduct the analysis and ipynb file to make the table to be directly used in latex file.

The manuscript contains the bibliography and codes in latex to replicate the paper. File [https://github.com/sergiozxy/Replication-Econometrics/blob/main/codes/cleaning.ipynb](cleaning.ipynb) is used to generate Table 1 and 2 in paper and File [https://github.com/sergiozxy/Replication-Econometrics/blob/main/codes/table_modification.ipynb](table_modification.ipynb) is used to generate Table 3 and 4 in paper.

The dataset contains the necessary data and the exported tables. To remove the tables that is generated you can refer to [https://github.com/sergiozxy/Replication-Econometrics/blob/main/verification_before_coding.ipynb](verification_before_coding.ipynb)
